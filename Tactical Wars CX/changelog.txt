TODO:
- Real position detection algorithm
- AI
- use path finding rather than direct flight

0.2:
- Fixed a typo in the code that might have caused issues at the end of a game
- Fixed an issue that caused the game to crash at the end, if the user had returned from the unit selection screen to the menu before playing
- Fixed total damage & previous damage sometimes showing wrong values
- Added a simple in-game menu
- Added a proper victory screen
- Added a help screen
- Implemented a proper algorithm that generates a list of cells within a certain range (rather than being hard coded)
- If the player presses the "0" key, circles are drawn around the units for more visibility
- The fuel/fatigue now decreases/increases based on the distance moved
- Changed the attributes of different units for more balance
- The initial available area (on the only map) for placing units has been reduced
- Only one loop is now used to draw the units, rather than two
- Units now face the correct direction when the y-coordinate doesn't change while moving
- After placing the units, the cursor goes to the last unit placed rather than the HQ
- When attacking, only attackable units are drawn over
- If a move or an attack is canceled, the cursor returns to the unit
- Special units no longer disappear when Blue places them
- Blue units now initially face left
- Some minor code & UI changes
