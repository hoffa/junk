Pixel Escape (version 1.0)

Pixel Escape is a copter-like game for the TI-Nspire written in Lua. It includes
smooth gameplay, the ability to save the high score, ranks, "floating walls" and
increasing difficulty as the player gets further in the tunnel. Touching any of
the walls ends the game.

The controls are extremely simple; the "pixel" is controlled using the Tab or
Enter key. The high score is temporarily saved as soon as any of the walls is
touched, but the player still needs to press Ctrl + S or Ctrl + W to save the
score in the actual document. Press Ctrl + Menu to return to the title screen at
any moment.
