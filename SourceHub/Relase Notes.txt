Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok, so this is the first public beta release,
so if you find any bugs, please contact me at
rehn.christoffer@gmail.com, so I can fix them,
but this release should be nearly stable, there
are still some things to fix (some minor bugs,
validated W3C validation etc.). And if you have
any comments, want to ask for improvements, or
just want to contact me, do not hesitate.
