So what is it?
--------------

Owl is a fast, flexible, lightweight, and clean game engine for the TI-Nspire. Making games in Lua for the TI-Nspire (and in any language for any platform for that matter) can be quite a hassle. Owl makes it possible for anyone with some basic Lua knowledge to make good-looking 2D games quickly and with ease.
